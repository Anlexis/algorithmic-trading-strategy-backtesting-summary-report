# ── Structured-parameter credential screen ───────────────────────────────────
# Why this runs before invoke() rather than inside a node:
#
# The framework's mandatory output gate scans every value of every node result
# for credential patterns, and the backbone's first node copies the structured
# parameters verbatim into its own result. So a credential-shaped string
# anywhere in them makes the FIRST node of the graph fail, before any template
# code runs. What the caller receives is an error status with no indication of
# which parameter caused it.
#
# Declaring an inert contract is not immunity: validators IGNORE undeclared
# keys, and ignoring is not stripping — an undeclared key still travels in
# state and still reaches that first node. The screen therefore runs over the
# whole mapping as submitted.
#
# Scanning field by field composes exactly to scanning the whole mapping (the
# detector on a mapping is the union over its values), which is what lets the
# refusal name the offending field without widening or narrowing the match.
#
# Field NAMES are caller-controlled too, so a name is repeated back only when it
# is short and inert; anything else is reported by position. The rejected value
# and the matched text are never echoed, in the response or in the audit record.
